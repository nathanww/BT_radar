A sensory substitution expeirment that lets you use a wear OS watch to perceive the reflection of Bluetooth signals.

The Wear OS app reads advertisements from a specific Bluetooth beacon address and translates the received signal strength into a sdubtle vibration. Because the signal strenght depends mostly on reflections from nearby objects, you can feel changes as you move around a spoace (or people/objects move around you)

For best results, put the beacon on the side of your body opposite the watch. Your body will block the direct signal path, meaning that most of the signal will be reflected from nearby objects.

You can also use the signal-absorbing properties of your body to localize reflections. With the beacon and watch on your left and right sides, signals will primarily reflect objects ahead of and behind you. By turning in place and observing the signal strenght, you can locate what is reflecting the signal.
